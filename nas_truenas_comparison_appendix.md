## Appendix: Scripted NAS vs. TrueNAS

This section compares your script-driven Ubuntu NAS setup with TrueNAS to help users decide which path suits their needs.

| Feature/Capability           | Scripted Ubuntu NAS               | TrueNAS (CORE/SCALE)               |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Base OS**                 | Ubuntu (Debian-based)             | FreeBSD (CORE) / Debian (SCALE)    |
| **ZFS Support**             | Native (ZFS on Linux)             | Native (ZFS on FreeBSD/Linux)      |
| **Web UI**                  | Optional (Cockpit/Webmin)         | Full-featured integrated UI        |
| **Customizability**         | High — full control               | Medium — GUI-bound choices         |
| **Performance (Linux)**     | Excellent (on modern hardware)    | Slightly slower (FreeBSD)          |
| **Package Ecosystem**       | Vast (APT repositories)           | Limited (FreeBSD PKG / curated)    |
| **Snapshots & Replication** | Scripted and flexible             | Integrated and GUI-managed         |
| **Automation**              | Fully scriptable, CLI-first       | API/cron-based (GUI-led)           |
| **Learning Curve**          | Steeper (Linux/ZFS/sysadmin)      | Easier (GUI-first)                 |
| **VM/Container Support**    | Optional via KVM/libvirt          | Built-in (SCALE only)              |
| **Community Support**       | Broad (Ubuntu/Debian)             | Focused (TrueNAS-specific)         |

**Summary**:
- Use **this scripted NAS** if you value speed, control, and automation, and are comfortable in Linux.
- Use **TrueNAS** if you prefer a GUI-first experience with managed workflows.

Both are powerful — choose based on your experience and comfort level.
