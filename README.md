# DIY NAS Setup

This project provides a fully script-driven setup for building a reliable, modular NAS (Network-Attached Storage) on Ubuntu using tools like ZFS, Samba, UFW, and optional web interfaces.



# Why this project
This is a very opinionated installation, surly it's not perfect, I did it because at the end of the day all systems that I have tried needs that you do some kind of commandline work.
E.g. when I create a pool with one disk, I know that it's one disk, I do not need at warning telling me that there is no redundancy. As far as I know, ZFS is the best for a NAS, speed, snapshot etc.

in one system I spend 30 hours for it to check my array, just to tell med that I had 38.000 errors on my hard drive - it was an array of 4 brand new 4TB WD RED NAS drives.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or newer
- Root privileges
- Internet access (for installing packages)

---

## ðŸ“‚ How to Use

1. Clone or extract this repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rabol/diy-nas.git
   ```
2. Make sure all scripts are executable:
   ```bash
   cd diy-nas
   chmod +x *.sh
   ```
3. Run the orchestrator: it will run all scripts or you can run each script manually
   ```bash
   ./index.sh
   ```

> You can comment out optional steps inside `index.sh` if not needed (e.g., `Cockpit`, `Webmin`, `Wrap-up`).

## ðŸ“‘ Documentation

Detailed documentation is available in:

**`installation.md`**  
Explains every step from prechecks to optional UI setup and backup strategy.

---

## ðŸ§© Optional GUI Management

- `98-install-cockpit.sh`: Cockpit GUI at `https://<NAS_IP>:9090`
- `99-install-webmin.sh`: Webmin GUI at `https://<NAS_IP>:10000`

---

## âœ… Final Validation

- Use `13-validate-installation.sh` to confirm services and storage are configured as expected.
- Run `100-wrapup.sh` to finish with a summary and reboot option.

---

## ðŸ›  Logging

Each script writes detailed logs to:
```
/var/log/nas-setup/
```

---

## ðŸ”’ Note

This setup assumes youâ€™re working in a trusted LAN environment. Still, UFW and SSH hardening steps are included for best practice.

Enjoy your clean, modular, scriptable NAS ðŸŽ‰
